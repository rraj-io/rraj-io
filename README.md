# Hi there 👋, I'm Rohit Raj

### 🚀 Scientific Machine Learning Researcher

I’m focused on **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)** — blending physics, deep learning, and optimization to solve complex engineering problems. I explore physics-informed neural networks, latent space design optimization, and generative models for fluid and turbine systems.

📌 My work spans:
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)  
- Deep Generative Models (e.g., GANs, VAEs)  
- Latent Space Optimization  
- Fluid Dynamics & CFD applications
